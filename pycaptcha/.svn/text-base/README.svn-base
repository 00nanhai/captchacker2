======================
Python CAPTCHA package
======================

About
-----

This is the PyCAPTCHA package, a collection of Python modules
implementing CAPTCHAs: automated tests that humans should pass,
but current computer programs can't. These tests are often
used for security.

See  http://www.captcha.net for more information and examples.

This project was started because the CIA project, written in
Python, needed a CAPTCHA to automate its user creation process
safely. All existing implementations the author could find were
written in Java or for the .NET framework, so a simple Python
alternative was needed.

Examples
--------

Included are several example programs:

  - simple_example.py is a bare-bones example that just generates
    and displays an image.

  - http_example.py is a longer example that uses BaseHTTPServer
    to simulate a CAPTCHA's use in a web environment. Running this
    example and connecting to it from your web browser is a quick
    and easy way to see PyCAPTCHA in action

  - modpython_example.py is a version of http_example that runs
    from an Apache server equipped with a properly configured
    mod_python.


Dependencies
------------

- Python 2.2.1 or later
- the Python Imaging Library, required for visual CAPTCHAs
