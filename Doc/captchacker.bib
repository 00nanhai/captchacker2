  abstract = {The Captchacker Project exploits the potential of Support Vector Machines
	to break visual captchas. We define "simulation-based" and "captcha-based"
	methods to build our models.
	
	
	Our method performs extremely well for breaking easily-segmentable
	captchas, with a robust recognition. We also give a generalization
	to non easily segmentable - thus harder to break - captchas, using
	Dynamic Programming. Besides, we explain how to get a large training
	set without going through the long and boring task of manual labelling.
	
	
	Finally, our source code is available (for free!) on our project website.},
